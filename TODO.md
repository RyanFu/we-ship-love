TODO
=======

* Finishing to apply styled-components for each component, used in containers (no styles in there).
* Getting rid of styles folder then.
* Merging data & utils folders to lib.
* Find a way to structure the state with shipping / delivery options.

### Optimizations

* styled-components: Use `attrs` for Picker.itemStyle, AccordionPicker.underlayColor...
* Navigator: Move to react-navigation (or react-native-navigation / native-navigation)
* Get rid of `import *` on every file
