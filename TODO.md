=======

* Make the payment working through Stripe! (French testing card: 4000002500000003)
* Get a RefreshButton in every renderContent method, in case the network breaks!

### Optimizations

* styled-components: Use `attrs` for Picker.itemStyle, AccordionPicker.underlayColor...
* Navigator: Refactoring to react-navigation (or react-native-navigation / native-navigation) to get navigation state in reducers.
