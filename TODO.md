TODO
=======

* Get the total in the banner for PaymentMethod / Payment!
* Switch react-native-card-input for classic form inputs: need firstName & lastName separated.
* Get a RefreshButton in every renderContent method, in case the network breaks!

### Optimizations

* styled-components: Use `attrs` for Picker.itemStyle, AccordionPicker.underlayColor...
* Navigator: Refactoring to react-navigation (or react-native-navigation / native-navigation) to get navigation state in reducers.
