# Roadmap

* Interact with the Shopify API to get the available shippings
* Update the 'shipping options' page based on the country selected before
* Get the static pages (My orders, FAQ, etc.) done

# Optimisations

* Navigator: Check why we need to pass 'index' on every push
* Delivery form: Check the need of auto-correct for every field
* Get rid of `import *` on every file
