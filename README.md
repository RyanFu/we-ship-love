# We Ship Love - Mobile application

This repository contains the mobile storefront source code for [We Ship Love](https://weshiplove.com/). It has been built with React Native, the Shopify SDK, Redux and Styled-Components. The goal of exposing the source code is to show to the community an example of React Native application using the Shopify APIs and their Mobile Buy SDK. Also, it can be seen as a showcase to demonstrate what I'm currently busy with. Any feedback is welcome! :)

**Still in development!**
