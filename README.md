# MQDF - iOS Application

[Mieux Que Des Fleurs](http://www.mieuxquedesfleurs.com/) (*Better Than Flowers*) is a french website whose aim is to spread love with parcels: Order and send baloons to your beloved ones!

This repository is the iOS application built with React-Native. **Still in development!**
