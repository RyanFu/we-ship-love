# MQDF - iOS Application

[Mieux Que Des Fleurs](http://www.mieuxquedesfleurs.com/) (or "Better Than Flowers" in english) is a french website whose aim is to spread love with parcels: Order and send baloons to your beloved ones!

This repository is the iOS application built with React-Native. (Still in development...)

### Installation

* Install node > v4.0 (NVM strongly recommended).
* Install 'watchman' with brew: `brew install watchman`.
* Intall 'react-native-cli' globally: `npm install -g react-native-cli`.
* Install all the node modules required: `npm install`.


### Get started

* You will need your Shopify administration access to get it running!
* Create a file `./config/API.js` which exports `API_HOSTNAME`, `API_KEY`, `API_PASSWORD`, variables that you get from your Shopify administration.
* Run the project: `react-native run-ios`.


### Links
* This cool [React Native Starter](https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-starter-app) has been used to start the development.
